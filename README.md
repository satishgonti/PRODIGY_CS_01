# Simple Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python script provides a simple menu-driven implementation of the Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## overview
The script contains functions for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher, as well as a main function that provides a menu-driven interface for the user. The user can choose to encrypt text, decrypt text, or exit the program
## Functions
    encrypt(plaintext, n)

Encrypts the given plaintext using the Caesar cipher.
* plaintext: The text to be encrypted.
* n: The shift value for the Caesar cipher.

The function iterates over each character in the plaintext, checks if it is a space, uppercase, or lowercase letter, and applies the appropriate encryption logic. Spaces remain unchanged.

     decrypt(plaintext, n)

Decrypts the given ciphertext using the Caesar cipher.
* plaintext: The text to be decrypted.
* n: The shift value that was used during encryption.

The function iterates over each character in the ciphertext, checks if it is a space, uppercase, or lowercase letter, and applies the appropriate decryption logic. Spaces remain unchanged




## Main Function

    main()

The main function of the script provides a menu-driven interface to the user. It prompts the user to choose an action (encrypt, decrypt, or exit) and performs the corresponding operation.


## Usage
 
 1. Run the script.
 2. Follow the menu prompts to:
  Encrypt text: Enter the message and the shift value to     get the encrypted text.

  Decrypt text: Enter the encrypted message and the shift value to get the decrypted text.
  
Exit the program.


## Notes

* The shift value should be a positive integer.
* The script handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Spaces are preserved in the encrypted and decrypted text.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
